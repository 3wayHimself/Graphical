# Graphical

**Graphical** is a personal research project where I explore different topics I am interested about like algorithm theory, geometry, data structures or computer graphics.


## History

**Graphical** was originally conceived as a purely Dynamo Package, where I tried to understand and implement visibility graphs in order to find the shortest path on a given layout.

I soon realized that Dynamo's geometry library was too heavy for this purpose, so I started to create custom geometry primitives (vertices, vectors, lines...) in order to improve the performance.
